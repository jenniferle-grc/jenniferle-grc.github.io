				<h2>What Cal Poly Symphony's 2025-2026 Season Has to Offer</h2>
				<p>
					The Cal Poly Symphony embarks on its 2025-2026 season with an ambitious and dynamic program that speaks to both tradition and innovation. Anchored in the Performing Arts Center's Miossi Hall, the full 80-90-member
					student orchestra -- drawn from nearly every major on campus -- continues its commitment to artistry, collaboration, and immersive student engagement.
				</p>
				<p>
					The season opens in December with "Symphony and the Big Band," a daring fusion of symphonic strings and jazz ensemble, performed in collaboration with the University Jazz Band. Expect an inventive and genre-blending
					program featuring Shostakovich's Waltz No. 2 from Suite for Jazz Orchestra No. 2, Duke Ellington's Three Black Kings spotlighting tenor-saxophonist Ana Nelson, a brand-new work by composer Jamaal Baptiste, and Gershwin's
					iconic An American in Paris. This concert perfectly exemplifies the Symphony's mission to bridge classical traditions with contemporary and crossover voices.

				<p>
					In the heart of winter, the ensemble presents the Winter Concert: "Student Soloist Showcase and Pines of Rome," taking place in March. Here, audition winners from any Cal Poly major command center stage, showcasing the
					university's diverse pool of talent. These student artists share the evening with Ottorino Respighi's spectacular tone poem Pines of Rome, blending youthful energy with orchestral splendor.
				</p>
				<p>
					The season culminates in early June with "Symphonic Expressions," a landmark collaboration between the Symphony and Cal Poly's Choirs. The program spotlights two monumental choral-symphonic masterpieces: Stravinsky's
					Symphony of Psalms and, most notably, Beethoven's towering Symphony No. 9 -- a work central to the classical canon and a highlight of the season. This grand finale underscores the ensemble's artistic ambition, bringing
					together powerful compositions, vocal and instrumental forces, and the emotional gravity of one of Western music's greatest works.

					Across all three concerts, the Cal Poly Symphony showcases more than just performance -- it champions creativity, community, and innovation. From jazz collaborations to student soloists and choir integration, the season
					offers a rich tapestry of musical expressions that resonate far beyond the PAC. Whether connecting classical masterworks, new compositions, or student artistry, it's a season designed to celebrate the full spectrum of
					orchestral potential.
